Overview
--------

This github org hosts templates to accellerate bootstrapping of cloud
infrastructure projects. This includes terraform models for core infra
components, containerized app build/deploy templates, and system config
management examples.

The original goals were to have a sandbox for experimentation and along
the way capture reusable patterns for cloud based development and operations.

This code was initially built in the course of learning cloud tools, networking
and proxies, and testing of scalability and observability practices.
